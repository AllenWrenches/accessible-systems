To comply with Section 508 or the Americans with Disabilities Act your documents must also be accessible. Documents are tested for accessibility using various testing tools, some built into the application platform and others are the use of various screen readers. Most of our clients want us to also remediate the documents. Document types that we remediate are:

- Word
- PDF
- Power Point

If you have documents that you need to be made accessible, please contact us.
