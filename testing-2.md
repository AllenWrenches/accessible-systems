Our accessibility evaluation methodology is used to evaluate how well your mobile app conforms to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, an international set of standards from the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). We use a combination of methods to evaluate accessibility.

Manual Accessibility Evaluation

In manual evaluation, we will use iOS mobile accessibility tools to confirm issues and assess accessibility content for meaning and usability.

- VoiceOver
- Zoom
- Invert Colors
- Grayscale

For example, only a human evaluator can determine if the alternative text for an image is a meaningful equivalent of that image.
Because visually impaired screen reader users typically use gestures rather than a touch navigation, this method also provides insights into gesture accessibility for people who use other emulators, such as users with impaired motor abilities.

Our final report to you will detail if there are barriers, who is impacted, what technical requirement is not met, a priority for the barrier and lastly how to fix it so that you can have an understanding of how hard or easy it would be to fix it.
